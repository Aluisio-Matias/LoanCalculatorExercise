# LoanCalculatorExercise

The goal of this exercise was to fill in the JavaScript to make the loan calculator functional. 
The calculator takes an amount to loan (the principle), a term in years, and a yearly rate. 
The output should be the monthly payment of the loan.

Another goal was to test all the files using Jasmine JS testing library.
